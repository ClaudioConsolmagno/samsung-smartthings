﻿## Xiaomi Mijia Smart Switch - Smart Things Handler

This handler allows for single, double, triple and quadruple clicks. It's built based on code found on [bspranger repo here](https://github.com/bspranger/Xiaomi/blob/master/devicetypes/bspranger/xiaomi-button.src/xiaomi-button.groovy).

I have made this fork to learn about Smart Things while also adding functionality I thought was missing from the Mijia Switch.

I was looking primarily into adding multi-click functionality and in the end a lot of code for other non-essential functionality was removed as I personally didn't find useful. E.g. Button held functionality which didn't work so well for me.

This is the exact button I'm using which works well with multi-clicks: https://uk.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_257679.html?wid=1433363
